# E-Restro Restaurant Management System (https://rashmikajayasooriya.great-site.net/pos_project_page.html)

## Introduction
'E-Restro' is a comprehensive restaurant management software designed to automate and streamline daily operations. It provides a flexible and efficient way to manage inventory, menus, orders, and customers, significantly reducing manual effort and enhancing reliability.

## Document Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document serves as the foundation for the project, outlining both functional and non-functional requirements. It guides the project team in building software that meets client expectations and provides end-users with a clear understanding of the system's capabilities.

## Product Scope
The system aims to automate restaurant operations, offering solid customer service and benefits such as accurate information extraction, error handling, and report generation. It covers major operations including purchase order generation, meal item registration, menu generation, and customer handling.

## Users and Characteristics
'E-Restro' supports six user roles with specific privileges: Admin, General Manager, Assistant Manager, Kitchen Manager, Food and Beverage Manager, and Server. Each role is tailored to the unique needs of the restaurant's operational hierarchy.

## Operating Environment
The system is designed for Windows 7 or above, requiring a minimum of 512MB RAM, a Core i3 processor, and a 1024 x 768 resolution monitor. It also necessitates a laser printer for printing invoices and reports.

## Design and Implementation Constraints
- Jasper Reports may not function optimally under heavy workload.
- The user interface may not be fully responsive.
- Users must save sub-reports in a specified location on their computer.

## Specific Requirements
'E-Restro' includes various user interfaces for inventory management, supplier registration, meal and menu management, customer order processing, and report generation. It ensures efficient data handling and quick response times for user queries.

## Non-functional Requirements
The system is designed to perform database operations within 3 seconds, solve customer queries within 10 seconds, and load user interfaces within 6 seconds. Report generation and printing are streamlined for effectiveness.

## Safety and Security
Access to subsystems requires user identification to manage privileges appropriately.
